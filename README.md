# Boilerplate for React and GitHub Action

This template basically has [default cra react template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with GitHub Action script.

This template is actually for my coding club and not for the real usage.

## Usage

1. Make a repo from this template.
2. Change everything that says `CHANGEME` in the repo.
3. Setup the GitHub Pages.
4. You should be ready to go! Try going to `[your_username].github.io`. You should see the default react template.
5. Change the code using [github.dev](https://github.dev).

- Again, this template is for my coding club.
